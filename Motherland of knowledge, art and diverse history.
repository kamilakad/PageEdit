Abstract: These days our world encounters a serious problem of lost of interest to culture and traditions within the young generation. Unfortunately, young generation neither  has idea about history of their home country, nor they are aware of cultural identity. This trend is also visible in Uzbekistan, especially in Bukhara. Bukhara is an awesome place with a great number of historical monuments and holly places like mosques. For those, who are not interested in architecture, Bukhara is motherland of gifted people like Al Bukhari, Avicenna and others, who made a great contribution not only to Uzbekistan history, but also oversees. Being a city with rich cultural identity and diversified traditions, Bukhara is well-known for its hospitality and kind local people. They believe that there are two factors that make trip to Bukhara unforgettable.  Firstly, unique architecture and secondly – local people. Kindness, self-devotion and hospitality are in blood of bukharian people. This article contains information about the most popular places of the city, greatest people, who were born here, local people and their attitude toward tourists and some kinds of crafts that became an indispensable part of our culture.

What is the first association, which appears in your mind when you hear the word “Bukhara”? A lot of people might say “Kalyan Minaret” or ‘’The Ark Fortress”. Surprisingly, but even local people find it difficult to describe their hometown without searching information in google. The fact that people do not realize how awesome their motherland and how rich our historical heritage is, makes feel like our history and culture are slowly disappearing.

Without a doubt, architecture plays an indispensable part of our heritage since there are a huge number of monuments located in Bukhara these days. Important monuments that survive from early times include the famous Ismail Samanai mausoleum, impressive in its elegance and the best surviving example of 10th century architecture in the whole Muslim world. The Ismail Samani mausoleum is the oldest building in Bukhara, standing west of the city center in a park erected during Soviet times. The mausoleum is extremely important from an art historical perspective as it is the earliest instance of an Islamic tomb to survive in Central Asia.

The outstanding Poi-Kalyan minaret, a masterpiece made of brick, came from the 11th century of Karakhanid period. The Kalyan Minaret is the last surviving fragment of the Kara-khanid era mosque built by Mohammad Arslan Khan in 1127, predating the Mongol conquests. It is one of only a handful of buildings to wholly or partially survive Genghis Khan's. Standing tall at 45.6 meters, this unlikely survivor of the city's early days—which so astonished Genghis Khan that he refused to order its destruction—continues to serve as the centerpiece of the city at the Po-i-Kalyan square. 

Last but not least, The Ark Fortress - one of the most interesting Bukhara historic buildings. The word "Ark" comes from the Persian “arg”, meaning citadel or castle, and is unrelated to the English word Ark which comes from the Latin “arca”,for large box or chest. Its foundations were laid in the 4th - 3rd centuries BCE. The fortress has been, of course, several times destroyed and rebuilt. The Ark Fortress is a vast citadel, measuring 3 hectares in area, located at the northwest corner of the walled city. According to one legend, the base of the fortress had seven pillars set up as to the locations of the Great Bear brightest stars. The say the builders succeeded in constructing the walls of the fortress only when they put the base pillars in this order.

Bukhara is the land of knowledge and motherland of the greatest scientists of the world, who spread their knowledge through around the world and established new fields of studies. There is no doubt that, people living here inherited strong genes from our outstanding scholars.   Bukhara was the birthplace of scholar Imam Bukhari. Muhammad ibn Isma'il al-Bukhari a 9th-century Muslim muhaddith. Imam Mohammed Al-Bukhari is considered as one of the most distinguished scholars of Hadith in Islamic history. His book Sahih al-Bukhari, in which the Prophet's words, actions, or habits were collected, is one of the greatest sources of the prophetic influence in history. During his youth he memorized the Holy Quran and learned the basics of religion. He had memorized thousands of Ahadiths while he was still a young boy. Bukhara's atmosphere, which was then one of the centers of science, also helped him. Al-Bukhari's works include the hadith collection Sahih al-Bukhari, Al-Tarikh al-Kabir, and Al-Adab al-Mufrad. 

Moreover, Bukhara is a home for Abu Ali ibn Sina, also known in the West as Avicenna. He is considered to be  father of early modern medicine, whose works became a standard medical text at many medieval universities and remained in use as late as 1650. He is probably the most significant philosopher in the Islamic tradition and arguably the most influential philosopher of the pre-modern era. His influence in medieval Europe spread through the translations of his works first undertaken in Spain. In the Islamic world, his impact was immediate and led to what Michot has called “la pandémie avicennienne”, which means “Avicenna pandemic”.  

What about Abdurauf Fitrat? An outstanding author, leader of the jadid movement and politician in Central Asia under Russian and Soviet rule. He was born in 1886 in Bukhara in an educated family and studied at madrasas and dorilfuns in Bukhara and Istanbul. In XX century the jadid’s movement started to play a key role within the society and the main purpose of this movement was to increase the spirituality and provide education for all walks of life. For example, M. Behbudi in Samarkand, M. Abdurashidkhanov in Tashkent, A. Fitrat in Bukhara and others were the most active in spreading this ideology. They built schools, educated people and wrote numerous books in Uzbek and Russian languages. There are many other poets, scholars and politics from Bukhara, who contributed to our culture and left their footprint on history, known both: locally and overseas.

It's not a surprise that such great people are all from our town, because since ancient times Bukhara has been not only an important economic and cultural center in Central Asia, but also a center of science and enlightenment in ancient Turan. Religion and secular sciences (such as history, poetry, astronomy, medicine, mathematics, and jurisprudence) developed here. The education itself commonly focused on religion aspects of Muslims. There were several hundred mosques built in the traditions of ancient pre-Muslim and Muslim architecture. Educational institutions were of two types: primary school - maktab and higher - madrasah. In maktabs, which were usually at mosques, the teachers were imams(higher spiritual ministers). Here they taught to read the Koran. During their studies at the madrasah, they studied Arabic literacy and writing, the interpretation of the Koran. In order to receive education, thousands of people from  Khiva, Kokand, Samarkand, Kazan, Orenburgand other cities of the Muslim world came to Bukhara to study. As a result, by the middle of the 19th century, the lists of students in the Bukhara madrasah numbered from 9 to 10 thousand people. 

Even today, thousands of talented students are showing incredible results in their studies. Many of them are actively participating in international competitions and exchange programs. There are a huge number of students from Bukhara who is studying in top universities all around the world: United States, Great Britain, Singapore, China, Korea and others. According to statistics, in 2021 Bukhara has shown the highest results during the entrance examination to University - 75,28, outstripping Tashkent and Fergana.

Many foreigners say that there is a special atmosphere of Uzbek culture that can be felt only in Bukhara. Compared to other cities like Tashkent or Samarkand, people here cherish traditions and keep our culture deeply inside in hearts. Almost every corner of this gorgeous city is saturated with Uzbek atmosphere and has its own history. Even people here are different. Bukharian people are the most genial and charitable, they are always ready to lend a hand to everyone, regardless of nationality or age. if you ever get lost, for sure, people will help you to find the way and this will be done selflessly, from the heart.

Another essential detail of local people – it’s the way people are dressed. Every third person here wears at least one element of national cloth, whether it adrass dress or simple skullcap. Some people wrongly call this feature as “Relic of the past”, but this the way we show respect for our traditions. Thousand people all around the world are amazed by our national cloth and ready to pay large sums of money just to try on adrass and atlas dresses, skullcaps or chapan. Our national cloth is so unique, that ancient technology for making satin and adras from silk fabrics of Uzbekistan is included in the list of UNESCO best practices for safeguarding the intangible cultural heritage.

Talking about cloth, the most noticeable aspect of majority national cloth is golden sewing. It is known that Bukhara is the capital of gold embroidery, and the works of Bukhara artisans are a national brand (Gold embroidery masterpieces are given to the stars. For example, the famous photos of Ronaldo in an embroidered Bukhara chapan).  There are two main types of gold embroidery used in Bukhara: “zarduzi-zaminduzi” – solid embroidery of golden background and “zarduzi - gulduzi” – pattern (flower) sewing. Besides the clothes, the household items were decorated with golden sewing. They are: lula-bolish – bolsters, takyacha – pillowcases for pillows, djoypush – coverlets for a wedding bed, takhmonpush – curtains for niches, djoynamos – praying carpets, chimillik - curtains for separating the dwelling. 
Gold ornaments of Bukhara skilled craftsmen decorate the museum exhibitions in Uzbekistan, they are kept in the museums of foreign countries - Russia, India, Indonesia, China and others. Bukhara zarduzis are the indispensable participants of international exhibitions.

Bukhara is a place that gathers thousands of people together regardless of their nationality and background. A lot of tourists visit our city in order to see a piece of history which is left from our ancestors. The history, the atmosphere of ancient Bukhara can be felt in everything: architecture, cloth, food and dances. It is important to realize that Bukhara is not just a place where we were born, but also an amazing city with deep history, city of great people and city of traditions. 

As a person who was born in Bukhara and who spend whole life here, I am so proud to be a daughter of this wonderful land. Unfortunately, I came to this opinion quite late and like a majority of other teenagers did not realize how amazing Bukhara was. It’s not surprising that whaen we were young we did not pay much attention on what happened around us, but later, people start to look at things from different perspectives, their attitude changes and they finally accept the fact that there is no better place in the world than a motherland. Bukhara is a place where my parents, grandparents and great-grandparents have spent their whole lives. Like a family tree, this city keeps history of my ancestors from their first steps until the last breath on this earth. This endless chain will continue with my children, grandchildren and their descendants, like a blood thread will link our lives in one history.

History should never be forgotten, otherwise there is a huge risk of loosing our identity and link with our ancestors. That’s why it is vital to remember the greatest people of your hometown and pay tribute to them for their contributions. That’s why we should always honor our traditions that appeared thousand years ago. That’s why we should share our history with our descenders, in order to keep our incredible culture deeply inside in our hearts, even when we stay far away.
